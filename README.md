# Learning-CSharp-
This is my repository for completed work in c# from the freecodecamp/microsoft free C# certification
All of the work I did type instead of using copy paste to help myself learn better or undersrand concepts better but all work was a copy of the finished project to match. Looking at my mistakes along the way and comparing exactly what I did wrong even if it was just miss namming a variable really helped me understand the concepts of the c# language.
